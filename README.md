Perceptron learning

Deep Neural networks
  -too many inputs very difficult to process

convolution neural networks
  - how eyes work 
  - divide the whole image for ex into several areas and attach a neuron to each one of them
  - compile them back
  
Recurrent neural netowkrs 
  - the output depends on the input and the previous computations
  - there is time variable here
  - 
  
Autoencoders
  - when you have high dimensional data, move it into lower dimensions and then work on it 
  - encoding with weights 
  - decoding again with weights?
